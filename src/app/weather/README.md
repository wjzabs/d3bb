# How to use the application

Let's learn how to launch and interact with our frontend application. The app itself is built upon following core technologies: D3.

Here's how we interact with the application inside of the IDE:
- Wait for the automatic package installations to complete and for the `Run` button to become clickable. Packages are essential for the application functionality;
- Once the app is ready to be launched – now you can hit `Run` to execute it;
- Your frontend preview would be available in the `Browser` tab. And your logs in the `Console` tab;
- Also, in the `Browser` tab you can see the generated URL, so you can open and preview your app "live" right in your browser;
- Feel free to play with the code the way you want. All your changes would be saved automatically. Also, if you ever get stuck and would want to reset your app to the original form – just hit the `Reset` button (at the top-right corner of the code window);
- That's it!
